## Description

Wemos as ISP is an interface card that plugs into Wemos mini board ESP8266, to allow the programming of 8-pin ATtiny 25/45/85 controllers and 14-pin ATtiny 24/44/84 controllers

## Hardware
The electronic board project files are found here: <br>

## Test circuits
To test the correct programming of the ATtiny microcontrollers I created two test circuits for ATtiny85 and ATtiny84.
